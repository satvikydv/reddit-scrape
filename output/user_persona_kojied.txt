Having moved to the city three years ago, possibly on an H1B visa, he is deeply engaged with the worlds of technology, finance, and social systems. He is an early adopter, constantly tinkering with new platforms like the Apple Vision Pro to optimize his workflow and explore future possibilities. In his spare time, he ideates and even creates mock-ups for apps that could solve problems he observes, from consumer decision-making to climate change. He is driven by a desire to understand, optimize, and build the future, whether it's through code, options trading, or philosophical deconstructions of his favorite anime.
